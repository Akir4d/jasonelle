*Jasonelle* is a Framework that uses [JSON](https://www.json.org/) as the main language
to create *Android* and *iOS* applications.

## 📅 [Releases](RELEASES.md)

Releases are made once a year in November. See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md). Each release strive
to only bring bug fixes, new features and maintain backwards compatibility. So an app made
with *Jasonette 1* can be executed successfully with *Jasonette 100* in the future.

## 📱 Jasonette

*Jasonette* is an amazing tool. It let you simplify the complex process of
building native mobile apps. With *Jasonette* you have the power of *JSON + Javascript*
at your hands. **Totally Native!**. No html or weird build tools needed. Just
good old *JSON*.
